There are many posts about this. Here's mine.

## Getting Things Done with a capital GTD

My concept of Getting Things Done is loosely based on
[David Allen](http://www.davidco.com/)'s book about Getting Things Done. I say
loosely because I never finished it. Seriously that thing should have been
about half as long. But here's what I took from it and have been applying in
my own life for MAXIMUM BENEFIT:

### Have a system. Trust the system.

You should have a system in place to manage your tasks and you should trust
that system completely. Like you'd play the trust game with it where you
fall backwards. You'd admit to it that you really like that new Taylor Swift
song. Etc.

The whole point is to get all these tasks out of your head so you don't have
to worry about them. You know you'll get to them because you have a system. If
you don't trust the system you'll worry.

### Have contexts

The system should have a concept of "contexts". A context is "where" you are
when you are peforming tasks. For example, I have a "work" context and a
"home" context. I don't want to think about work tasks while I'm at home,
and vice versa.

### Have an inbox

The system should have a dumping ground for new tasks. Official GTD dogma
calls this dumping ground the inbox. I call it that too because I like
things that can be confused with email.

You don't want to manage tasks in your head. When you think "Oh snap I really
need to do X" at a time when you can't do X, instead of trying to decide when
you should do X and what are all the details and where does it fall in your
priorities and you better add it to the project wiki and AGH! Just dump your
half-thought-out thought into your inbox and forget about it. Get on with what
you're doing right now with a clear head. You know that thought is somewhere
safe. You trust your system, remember? You'll come back to it later.

<span class="cough">I just realized "Do X" can be interpreted as a literal
task if you do drugs.</span>

Later, when you're actually ready to Get some Things Done you can review your
inbox. Maybe that thing wasn't really all that important and you can just
delete it. Maybe it's something that can be done in 2 minutes so you just go
ahead and take care of it right away. Maybe it's something you want to do, but
not right now. That's when you file it under a context. Additionally you might
flesh out some of the details or prioritize it as part of a project.

## Evernote

The system I use for this is [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/). It's not
explicitely designed for GTD, but I think that's a good thing. It's designed
to take and organize notes. A note can be a simple text document, an email, a
photo, a screenshot, a PDF...

It's also very easy to take these notes, whether you are in the app or not.
This is important. If you have to run to your computer or even just jump to a
particular app to dump something out of your head, you're a lot less likely to
do it.

### Notes

![Some example Evernote notes](http://img.skitch.com/20101028-m25rkxjnu66gm3nwtsjmybgxsf.jpg)

For me, a note in Evernote may correspond to a task, it may contain a list of
tasks, or it may just be what the app was originally designed for: a note.

### Notebooks

![My Evenote Notebooks](http://img.skitch.com/20101028-cupkidsurjwkkb8gji96fyhuqy.jpg)

Every note in Evernote belongs to a notebook. I set up the following:

**Inbox**: I tell Evernote to put new notes here by default. Pro tip: I
name it "!nbox" so it shows up first alphabetically.

**TODO**: When I go through my inbox (daily at least) and I come across a
note that I consider a task but don't want to do right now, I tag it (more
on that later) and then file it in the TODO notebook.

**Reference**: Anything that's not a task, but still something I want to
remember gets tagged and moved to the Reference notebook. I use this for
things like server login credentials (Evernote supports encryption!),
requirement lists, etc.

### Tags

![My Evernote Tags](http://img.skitch.com/20101028-tccahwyqxwm4s3xmmt7nk6213i.jpg)

I use tags in Evernote for contexts and projects and priorities. Three
things because haven't you heard? Tags are versatile!

In order to make sense of things, I prepend context tags with @. So I might
have tags like @work and @home. Prioritization tags are prepended with an
underscore (e.g. \_urgent). The rest of the tags represent a project (or just a
category, e.g. "receipts").

The neat thing is that since tags are organized alphabetically, naming them
this way makes contexts fall at the top of the list, followed by priorities,
then projects/categories. Making it easy to do some cmd-clicks to see all of
my @work tasks that are \_urgent.

### Getting tasks out of your head

Since Evernote has lots of neat extensions and peripherals, I can easily throw
something into my inbox from anywhere.

#### At my computer

![Some global Evernote shortcuts](http://img.skitch.com/20101028-twqnkiicpjen6sn8ax6eyf9hji.jpg)

Having Evernote installed gives me some global shortcuts I can use even when
I'm not in the Evernote application. I can hit a key combination to enter a
quick text note, "clip" all or part of my screen to a new note, or paste the
contents of my clipboard to a new note.

Clipping (taking a screenshot) of part of my screen is especially handy for
saving receipts of online orders or remembering IM conversations about a task
you'll need to do later.

There are also browser extensions for saving web pages to a new note. You can
"clip" the whole page, or simply save the url and add a text note to it. I'll
use this if there's a web app I want to check out later, an article I want to
read later, or a blog post about some sweet new Ruby on Rails feature I want to
apply in one of my many and amazing internet web applications.

I said "browser extensions" (plural) but I'm actually only aware of
[the Chrome one](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/pioclpoplcdbaefihamjohnefbikjilc).
It's good. There are probably others. Maybe.

[Yes. There are.](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8381/)

#### Not at my computer (oh no)

When I'm away from my computer I always have my smart telephone with me so I
use the [Evernote Android App](http://www.appbrain.com/app/evernote/com.evernote).
There's an iPhone version too if that's how you roll.

#### At a sucky computer

When I'm on a computer where Evernote is not installed (or not supported...
<span class="cough">Linux</span>) everything is also accessible via the
website.

Plus there's still the browser extensions.

*And it's all synced!*

### Prioritization

One (seemingly) bad thing about using a note storage app as a task management
app is that you lose fine-grained prioritization of tasks.

So I prioritize with tags.

Using tags for prioritization has actually turned this downside into an upside
for me. I only have three tags for this: \_urgent, \_important, and \_billable.

The difference between \_urgent and \_important is subtle: \_urgent tasks have
to be addressed RIGHT NOW or _the world will end_. \_important tasks are tasks
that don't have to be addressed right now, but I don't want them to get
burried under all the trivial stuff. "Fix the bug that's publishing everyone's
social security numbers to Facebook!" would be tagged \_urgent. "Pay the
bills" would be \_important.

\_billable should be obvious...

The simplicity keeps me from wasting time micro-managing my todo list. Maybe
this isn't a problem for most people but I tend to obsess over things like
that.

It also keeps me from letting the list of tasks get too long. Since I only
have these few tags, I don't want to let the list of \_urgent tasks get to the
point that I feel like I need a \_really\_urgent tag to distinguish between
them.

Other than that the notes are sorted by the "created on" date, oldest first.

#### But...! But...!

![Example of multiple tasks in one note](http://img.skitch.com/20101027-erttceuhuf9u52w9attpsds8xt.jpg "Example of multiple tasks in one note")

But sometimes you have a big long list of things that absolutely have to be
completed in a very specific order and that order may not map directly to a
"created on" date. Calm down! In those cases I just throw all the tasks into
one note. One task does not have to correspond to one note. I never said that.
Stop saying that I said that.

"Start a tech blog" has been one of my tasks for like... a year, and this is the
first post. I hope that doesn't invalidate everything you just read. Maybe
just pretend like I didn't tell you that.
