title: Cucumber & RSpec boilerplate with bddgen
layout: post
summary: Just pushed out a quick little gem to generate some boilerplate common to most of my ruby projects.
---

Whenever I add things like [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) and
[RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) to a ruby project, I always have to
go back to old (or other people's) code to remember the best way to add and
configure things. Particularly the rake tasks. So I wrote
[a gem to generate all that boilerplate for me](https://github.com/blaix/bddgen).
I called it **bddgen**. It can do [YARD](http://yardoc.org) too.

All the instructions are in [the README on github](https://github.com/blaix/bddgen).
I almost repeated it all here. Then I didn't.

Of course, this is for projects that don't already have generators for things
like that. If you're writing a rails app or something, then
[it's not *for* you](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/3/24/).
