title: How to Sell Pair Programming
layout: post
summary: Part of a discussing about "introducing XP" that focused on pairing
---

A while back I had an email discussion with an old colleague who was trying to
introduce some [XP principles](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/) into his
team's process. Part of the discussion focused on
[pair programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html). Since
I've had discussions like this several times, I decided to convert it into a
blog post so I can point here instead of repeating myself. Efficiency!

I've been on a couple teams that said they do pair programming "sometimes" and
on another that says they do it "always". In my experience, pairing "sometimes"
really means "every once in a while when someone is having a problem". It's
more like "occasional pair debugging" in those cases. The team that did it
always really did do it always. Not pairing was the exception for that team.
And let me tell you: I got a *lot* of work done every day working on that team.
When you pair all the time, it's very hard to get distracted. At the end of the
day I was mentally and physically exhausted!

The team also rotated pairs. I think this is important. You do want to
mix it up so juniors get mixed with seniors, people with lots of
context/knowledge on a subject get paired with people with little, and
you want to avoid cliques and silos. Doing it this way brings up the
level of the entire team. Junior people progress to senior level skill
and everyone has shared knowledge of the project as a whole instead of
each person knowing their small piece.

It is sometimes a tough sell. It's easy to see it as
cutting your productivity in half. It might be easier to sell a couple "pairing
days" per week to test the waters. See how the team likes it and if they do
they can help sell it. Or hey, maybe once or twice a week just slowly becomes 3
or 4 days a week and no one notices.

## The selling points of pairing:

* Programmers are more likely to stay on task. Especially if you
rotate the pairs: you WANT there to be a bit of uncomfortableness to
avoid people buddying up and goofing off. Instead, they're more likely
to avoid doing things like checking email, facebook, whatever and
spend more time getting down to business. In my experience, in the
long run, you get more done in the same amount of time because of
this.

* If someone is sick, on vacation, etc. you don't run the risk of
loosing all the context for a particular piece of the system. You no
longer hear "oh, Joe was the one working on that. I don't know
anything about it" because with rotation, everyone is working on
everything.

* The skillset and coding style of the team begins to coalesce. That
means code reviews take much less time and you are less likely to hear
"Joe wrote this code, it's going to take me a while to figure out what
he was doing...".

* The skill level of everyone improves. With rotation, people learn
from each other. The backend pros get better at frontend work by
working with the frontend pros and vice versa (just one example).

* Programmers spend less time over-thinking a problem. When you are working
with someone else, you want to keep the momentum going and are more likely to
move on once you have an adequate solution instead of getting bogged down
trying to come up with the perfect solution.

All this can add up to more business value for a team where pairing is a good
fit. And don't think remote workers means pairing isn't a good fit (usually
it's more about time zones and work schedules), but that's a subject for
another post.
