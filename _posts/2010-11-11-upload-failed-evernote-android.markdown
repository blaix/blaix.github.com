  Are you getting the "Upload Failed" error since upgrading
  the Evernote Android app? Log out and log back in to fix it.

[I really like Evernote](/blog/gtd-with-evernote.html), and
[the new version of the Android app](http://blog.evernote.com/2010/11/08/evernote-for-android-takes-a-huge-leap-forward-with-version-2-0/)
is awesome, but after upgrading, I noticed I was getting **Upload Failed**
errors a lot. I would sometimes get these in the past when my signal was bad,
and the note would upload fine later, but I soon realized that since the 2.0
upgrade, *none* of my notes were getting uploaded. I saw them on the phone,
but not online and not in the desktop app.

I restarted the phone, checked for newer updates, shook it violently, nothing
helped. Google was no help either. When I finally fixed it I figured I should
help out with the lack of Google support by internet blogging about the fix on
my internet website.

In the end what fixed it was simply
**logging out of the app on the phone, and then logging back in**.

The downside is logging out clears the cache on your phone, which means
**all the notes I added since the upgrade were lost**. Luckily they weren't
too important. Just stuff like "todo: check if notes added on my phone are
being synced properly".

## Update:

I started experiencing the upload issue again. I didn't want to lose any notes
this time so I contacted support. They recommended I upgrade to the beta
version by visiting [this url](http://s.evernote.com/androidbeta) on my phone,
but by the time I go the message the uploads started working again.
